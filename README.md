# Harp Pedal Engraver for GNU Lilypond

An engraver that automatically tracks the current harp pedal setting and prints markings for pedal changes based on accidentals as they appear. This can dramatically reduce errors and speed the engraving of highly chromatic music for concert harp, and assist composers in writing for harp even if the pedal markings will not be printed in the published part.

Features include:
* Customizable support for different styles of pedal charts
* Correctly ignores notes played on the D and C strings.
* Support for positioning of pedal charts above, below, or in the middle of the harp grand staff.

See `tests.ly` for comprehensive usage examples.

When my time permits, I intend to submit this for inclusion in Lilypond.
